### R package: Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search with Screening (S5) ver. 1.1

  For ultrahigh-dimensional Bayesian variable selection in linear regression model, I proposed a scalable stochastic search algorithm called the Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search with Screening (S5) in [Shin et al. (2016)](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~minsuk/publications/nonlocal_sinica7.pdf). Even though the S5 was motivated by the Shotgun Stochastic Search  (SSS, Hans et al., 2007), its efficiency in searching interesting regions in the model space is remarkably improved by adopting a screening step within the algorithm. In  high-dimensional settings in the paper, not only did S5 find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model three hundreds times faster than the SSS did, but it also searched the exact same MAP model explored by the SSS in all considered 100 replicated data sets. Further, the S5 algorithm provides the full approximation of the posterior model probabilities including the marginal inclusion probability of each variable. The R package is optimized for using multiple cores in parallel computing environments, which accelerates the computation  for high-dimensional variable selection.
